# Magic Square

A magic square is a matrix of numbers in which the sums of elements in each row/column/diagonal are the same. That sum is called the magic sum.

For example:
```
Input:
  4 3 8
  9 5 1
  2 7 6

Output:
  It is a magic square with the magic sum 15.
  4 + 3 + 8 = 9 + 5 + 1 = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 (Rows)
  4 + 9 + 2 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 (Columns)
  4 + 5 + 6 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15 (Diagonals)
```
Write a program to check if the input matrix is a magic square or not. If it is a magic square, display the magic sum.

> Bonus: take the square side length as input and generate a magic square.
