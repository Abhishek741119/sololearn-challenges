# Spy Number

A number is called a Spy number, if the sum and product of its digits are equal.
For example, 123 is a Spy number, as the sum of its digits is 6 (1+2+3) which is equal to the product of its digits: 6 (1x2x3).

Write a program to check if the user input is a Spy number or not.

For example:
```
Input: 1412
Output: true

Input: 247
Output: false
```
**Bonus:** Print all the Spy numbers in a given range.
