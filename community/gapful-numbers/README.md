# Gapful Numbers

A gapful number is a number of at least 3 digits that is divisible by the number formed by the first and last digit of the original number.

For Example:
```
Input: 192
Output: true (192 is gapful because it is divisible 12)

Input: 583
Output: true (583 is gapful because it is divisible by 53)

Input: 210
Output: false (210 is not gapful because it is not divisible by 20)
```
Write a program to check if the user input is a gapful number or not.

> Bonus: Print all the gapful numbers in a given range.
