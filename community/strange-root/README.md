# Strange Root

A number has a strange root if its square and square root share any digit. For example, 2 has a strange root because the square root of 2 equals 1.414 (consider the first three digits after the dot) and it contains 4 (which is the square of 2).

Examples:
```
Input: 11
Output: true 
(the square root of 11 is 3.317, the square of 11 is 121. They share the same digit, 1.)
 
Input: 24
Output: false (the square root of 24 (4.899) and square (576) do not share any digits) 
```

Write a program to check if the user input has a strange root or not.
