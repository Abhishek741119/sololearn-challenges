# Anadrome

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase. For example, "Sool" is an anagram for "Solo".

A palindrome is a word or phrase which reads the same backward as forward, such as "madam".

An anadrome is a word or phrase if any of its anagrams form a palindrome.

For example:
```
Input: "SoloSolo"
Output: yes ("SoollooS" is an anagram of "SoloSolo" which also is a palindrome).

Input: "3haha"
Output: yes ("ha3ah" is an anagram of "3haha" which also is a palindrome).

Input: "Solo"
Output: no
```
Write a program to check if the user input is an anadrome or not.
