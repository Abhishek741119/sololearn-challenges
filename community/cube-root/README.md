# Cube Root

A cube root of a number x is a number y such that y*y*y = x.
Example: 2 × 2 × 2 = 8, so the cube root of 8 is 2.

Write a code to find the cube root of a number N  to a precision of 0.0001 without using any standard functions.

For example:
```
Input: 729
Output: 9

Input: 41
Output: 3.4482

Input: 2
Output: 1.2599
```
