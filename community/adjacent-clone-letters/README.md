# Adjacent Clone Letters

Suppose you have a 2D array of letters. A letter is adjacent to another if it is positioned either at the top, bottom, left, right, upper left, upper right, lower left or lower right of the other.

Create a program that accepts the dimensions of a 2D array and fills that array with random letters.
Then search through the array for adjacent similar letters.
Indicate which letters have adjacent clones and enumerate them. 
   
For example:
```
Input: 5x4
Output:
  Array:
    A C T T  S
    R T N G T
    E E G G A
    U W P F A
  Results:
    T = 4 adjacent clones
    G = 3 adjacent clones
    E = 2 adjacent clones
    A = 2 adjacent clones 
```
