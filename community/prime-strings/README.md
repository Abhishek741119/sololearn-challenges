# Prime Strings

A String is called prime if it can't be constructed by concatenating multiple (more than one) equal strings.

For example:
```
"abac" is prime, but "xyxy" is not ("xyxy" = "xy" + "xy").
```

Implement a program which outputs whether a given string is prime.

Examples
```
Input: "xyxy"
Output: "not prime"

Input: "aaaa"
Output: "not prime"

Input: "hello"
Output: "prime"
```
