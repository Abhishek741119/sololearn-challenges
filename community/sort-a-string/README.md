# Sort a String

Given a string as input, output its characters alphabetically sorted from A to Z.
For Example:
```
Input: challenge
Output: aceeghlln

Number should go first:
Input: happy42
Output: 24ahppy

Special characters, such as symbols, go before numbers and letters:
Input: $tar3
Output: $3art
```
Whitespaces should be ignored.
